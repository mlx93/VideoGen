# AI Video Generation Pipeline

## Background

Video generation with AI has transformed creative production. What once required teams of editors, motion designers, and sound engineers can now be orchestrated through intelligent pipelines that understand context, timing, and visual coherence.

Companies like Runway, Pika, and others have shown us what's possible. But true AI video generation isn't just about creating clips. It's about building cohesive narratives that seamlessly integrate image generation, video synthesis, audio, voiceovers, and timing.

Consider how Midjourney transformed image creation. Now imagine that same revolution for video production. A single prompt generates a complete music video synced to beats, or an entire ad campaign tailored to a brand's visual identity.

This project challenges you to build an end-to-end AI video generation pipeline that creates professional-quality video content with minimal human intervention.

## Why This Matters

The future of content creation is generative. Brands need hundreds of ad variations. Musicians want instant music videos. Creators need content at scale.

The team that builds the most robust, cost-effective pipeline wins not just this competition, but potentially defines the future of AI video production. You'll be building technology that could power the next generation of creative tools.

## Project Overview

This is a one-week sprint with a **$5,000 bounty** for the winning team.

### Key Deadlines

- **Start**: Friday, Nov 14, 2025
- **MVP**: Sunday (48 Hours)
- **Early Submission**: Wednesday (5 days)
- **Final**: Saturday (8 days)

You'll build a complete AI video generation pipeline that takes high-level prompts and outputs publication-ready video content with synchronized audio, coherent visuals, and professional polish.

## MVP Requirements (48 Hours)

This is a hard gate. To pass the MVP checkpoint, you must have:

- Working video generation for at least ONE category (music video OR ad creative)
- Basic prompt to video flow (text input to video output)
- Audio visual sync (video matches audio timing/beats)
- Multi clip composition (at least 3 to 5 clips stitched together)
- Consistent visual style across clips
- Deployed pipeline (API or web interface)
- Sample outputs (at least 2 generated videos demonstrating capability)

The MVP proves your pipeline works end to end. A simple but reliable music video generator beats a feature-rich system that produces incoherent output.

### Example MVP Architecture

At minimum, you should have:

- **Prompt Parser**: Interprets user input and extracts creative direction
- **Content Planner**: Breaks video into scenes/segments with timing
- **Generation Engine**: Calls AI models (video, image, audio) for each segment
- **Composition Layer**: Stitches clips with transitions and audio sync
- **Output Handler**: Renders final video in standard format (MP4, WebM)

## Core Pipeline Requirements

### Video Categories

You must support at least ONE of these categories with full end to end generation:

#### Category 1: Music Video Pipeline

- **Input**: Song file (generated or uploaded) + creative direction
- **Output**: Complete music video (1 to 3 minutes)

**Requirements:**

- Generate or accept AI generated music (Suno, Udio, etc.)
- Analyze song structure (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro)
- Detect beats and tempo for scene transitions
- Generate visuals that match song mood and lyrics
- Sync visual transitions to musical beats
- Maintain visual coherence across scenes
- Apply consistent style/aesthetic throughout

**Example Prompts:**

- "Create an ethereal music video for this ambient electronic track with floating geometric shapes"
- "Generate a high energy punk rock video with urban graffiti aesthetics"
- "Make a dreamy indie pop video with pastel colors and nature scenes"

#### Category 2: Ad Creative Pipeline

- **Input**: Product description + brand guidelines + ad specifications
- **Output**: Video advertisement (15 to 60 seconds)

**Requirements:**

- Generate product showcase clips

- Generate background music or sound effects
- Include voiceover capability (optional but bonus)

**Example Prompts:**

- "Create a 30 second Instagram ad for luxury watches with elegant gold aesthetics"
- "Generate 3 variations of a TikTok ad for energy drinks with extreme sports footage"
- "Make a product showcase video for minimalist skincare brand with clean white backgrounds"

#### Category 3: Educational/Explainer Pipeline (Bonus Category)

- **Input**: Topic/script + visual style preferences
