## Visual Pacing & Rhythm

### Matching Visuals to Musical Structure

**Core Principle:** The editing tempo and shot duration must align with musical structure to create rhythmic harmony.

**Verse Sections (Slower Tempo):**
- Use longer shots (5-10 seconds minimum) to establish character, story, or environment
- Slower cuts allow viewers to absorb narrative details
- Focus on character development, environment exploration, or emotional moments
- Camera movements should be deliberate and smooth (tracking shots, slow pans)
- Build atmosphere and context before energy increases

**Chorus/Drop Sections (Faster Tempo):**
- Use faster cuts (0.5-1 second shots) for high energy
- Bigger camera moves (whip pans, quick zooms, orbits)
- More extras, dynamic choreography, or visual complexity
- Cuts should land precisely on snare hits or strong beats
- **Reuse a recognizable anchor motif** (location, choreography, or framing) on every chorus for consistency

**Bridge Sections:**
- Often serves as emotional pivot or narrative shift
- Can use slower pacing for tension before climax
- Or accelerate for build-up to final chorus
- Match visual rhythm to musical dynamics

**Synchronization Techniques:**
- Land edits on musical beats (snare hits, bass drops, lyrical accents)
- Time camera movements (dollies, pans, orbits) to rhythmic motifs
- Match visual crescendos to musical builds (quick flashes preceding hooks)
- Create relief after high-energy sections with longer takes
- Balance continuous motion with abrupt transitions

### Visual Motif Repetition

**Anchor Motifs:**
- Establish a recognizable visual element that repeats at each chorus
- Examples: Specific location, choreography move, framing style, prop, or color
- Creates visual rhythm and helps viewer track song structure
- Should be visually distinct and memorable

**Repeating Elements:**
- Key props (red jacket, blonde wig, specific accessory)
- Character poses or gestures
- Camera angles or framing styles
- Color signatures or lighting patterns
- Reintroduce motifs strategically (not every clip, but at structural boundaries)

---

## Visual Metaphors & Symbolism

### Core Principles
- Use visual metaphors to represent lyrical themes and emotional content
- Symbolic objects can reinforce narrative without explicit explanation
- Visual storytelling should complement, not duplicate, the lyrics

### Common Visual Metaphors
- **Loneliness/Isolation:** Empty spaces, single figures in wide shots, reflections in mirrors, shadows
- **Freedom/Liberation:** Open landscapes, running/dancing, breaking barriers, upward camera movements
- **Love/Connection:** Two figures converging, hands reaching, shared spaces, warm lighting
- **Conflict/Struggle:** Confined spaces, barriers, contrasting colors, harsh lighting
- **Transformation:** Before/after shots, gradual changes in lighting/color, movement from dark to light
- **Time/Memory:** Clocks, old photographs, slow motion, flashback sequences
- **Power/Strength:** Low angles, upward movements, strong silhouettes, high contrast

### Color Symbolism
- **Red:** Passion, danger, intensity, love, anger
- **Blue:** Calm, sadness, tranquility, coldness, depth
- **Yellow:** Joy, energy, warmth, optimism, caution
- **Green:** Nature, growth, envy, freshness, harmony
- **Purple:** Mystery, luxury, creativity, spirituality
- **Black:** Mystery, darkness, elegance, power, emptiness
- **White:** Purity, innocence, simplicity, space, clarity
- **Orange:** Energy, enthusiasm, warmth, creativity

---

## Color Palette Guidelines by Mood

### Palette Bible Per Environment

**Core Principle:** Define a limited color palette (2-3 main colors) for each location and stick to it consistently.

**Per-Environment Palette:**
- Each scene/location should have its own color bible
- Limit to 2-3 dominant hues plus one accent color
- Maintain palette consistency within same location across all clips
- Use palette shifts to signal narrative or emotional changes (e.g., cold → warm when character gains power)

**Main Performer Color Signature:**
- Always give the main performer a distinct color signature (jacket, hair, or outfit) that stands out
- This signature color should remain consistent across all clips
- Helps viewer track main character visually
- Examples: Red jacket, blonde wig, specific colored accessory

**Color Contrast for Attention:**
- Use contrast to direct viewer attention
- Muted backgrounds make vibrant costumes pop
- High-key lighting emphasizes cleanliness or surrealism
- Low-key, shadowy lighting suggests mystery or danger

**Color as Symbolism:**
- Gold and brown: Heritage and tradition
- Monochrome: Distinguishes fantasy from reality
- Red: Passion, danger, rebellion
- Use color shifts to mark emotional or narrative changes

## Transition Styles & Techniques

### Transition Styles by Beat Intensity

### Hard Cut (0s duration)
**When to Use:**
- Strong beats (high intensity)
- High energy sections (chorus, breakdown)
- Dramatic moments
- Beat-synchronized cuts for impact
- Structural changes (verse → chorus)

**Characteristics:**
- Instant transition
- No overlap between clips
- Creates rhythm and energy
- Emphasizes beat synchronization

**Examples:**
- Chorus transitions
- High-energy verse changes
- Beat drops
- Dramatic narrative shifts

### Crossfade (0.5s duration)
**When to Use:**
- Medium beats (moderate intensity)
- Continuous motion between clips
- Verse transitions
- Narrative flow maintenance
- Smooth scene changes

**Characteristics:**
- 0.5 second overlap
- Gradual blend between clips
- Maintains visual continuity
- Smooth, professional transition

**Examples:**
- Verse to verse transitions
- Continuous character movement
- Scene location changes
- Time passage (day to night)

### Fade (0.5s duration)
**When to Use:**
- Soft beats (low intensity)
- Low energy sections
- Intro/outro transitions
- Emotional, contemplative moments
- Beginning/ending of song sections

**Characteristics:**
- Fade to/from black or white
- 0.5 second fade duration
- Creates emotional pause
- Signals section boundaries

**Examples:**
- Intro transitions
- Outro transitions
- Bridge sections
- Emotional breakdowns
- Contemplative moments

### Advanced Transition Techniques

**Match Cutting & Graphic Matches:**
- Align shapes, poses, or motions across scenes to stitch disparate images
- Create visual rhymes that connect different scenes
- Example: Match character pose from one scene to next, match ball arc to burning heads
- Use for: Surreal transitions, narrative connections, visual poetry

**World-Switch Effects:**
- Use rotoscope, morphs, page-tears, or environmental transformations for surreal transitions
- Examples: Tear-through effect (comic to reality), floor collapse, doorways between worlds
- Use for: Surreal concepts, fantasy sequences, narrative shifts
- Time world-switches to major musical hits or structural boundaries

**Geographical or Physical Transitions:**
- Continuous walk through spaces avoids obvious cuts (single-take illusion)
- Performers moving between rooms or sets provide natural edit points
- Hide cuts in whip pans, passing pillars, or bodies crossing the lens
- Use for: Immersive sequences, maintaining energy, seamless flow

**Beat-Synchronized Smash Cuts:**
- Default to hard, beat-synced cuts for energy
- Simple hard cuts on musical hits keep energy high
- Avoid over-editing in slower passages
- Use for: High energy sections, chorus transitions, beat drops

**Single-Take Concepts:**
- For single-take concepts, avoid cuts entirely
- Evolve performance, choreography, and blocking instead
- Camera movement becomes the transition
- Use for: Intimate performances, choreography showcases, immersive experiences

## Cinematography Principles

### Composition Rules

**Rule of Thirds:**
- Place subjects off-center (at intersection points)
- Creates visual interest and balance
- Avoid centering subjects (unless intentional)

**Leading Lines:**
- Use lines (roads, buildings, horizons) to guide viewer's eye
- Lines should point toward subject or focal point
- Creates depth and movement

**Depth:**
- Create depth with foreground/background elements
- Use layers: foreground, midground, background
- Shallow depth of field for subject isolation
- Deep depth of field for context

**Framing:**
- Use natural frames (doorways, windows, arches, ceiling beams)
- Frames focus attention on subject
- Creates visual hierarchy
- Architectural elements create frames within the frame
- Characters moving in and out of frames creates dynamic composition
- Examples: Doorways in Chandelier, windows in Cellophane, arches in HUMBLE.

**Symmetry vs. Asymmetry:**
- Symmetry: Calm, balanced, formal
- Asymmetry: Dynamic, interesting, modern
- Use based on mood and energy

### Shot Types

**Extreme Wide Shot (EWS):**
- Establishes location and scale
- Subject small in frame
- Use for: Intro, location establishment, atmosphere

**Wide Shot (WS):**
- Shows full subject and environment
- Subject clearly visible
- Use for: Context, action, scene setting, full choreography

**Medium Shot (MS):**
- Subject from waist up
- Balanced framing
- Use for: Dialogue, interaction, standard framing

**Close-Up (CU):**
- Subject's face or important detail
- Intimate, emotional
- Use for: Emotion, detail, emphasis

**Extreme Close-Up (ECU):**
- Very tight framing (eyes, hands)
- High intensity, intimate
- Use for: Dramatic moments, emotional peaks

### Shot Grammar & Combination

**Combining Shot Types:**
- Combine wide, static shots that show full choreography with tight shots on face/hands for emotion
- Alternate between establishing shots (wide) and intimate moments (close-up)
- Use shot variety to maintain visual interest while maintaining rhythm

**Centered, Symmetrical Compositions:**
- Prefer centered, symmetrical compositions for iconic images
- Creates memorable, poster-worthy frames
- Use for power moments, religious/ceremonial scenes, or key narrative beats
- Examples: Last Supper recreation, regal portraits, ritualistic scenes

**Memorable Frames (Tableaux):**
- Design shots so any frame could be a poster or thumbnail
- Clear subject, strong pose, simple background
- Use tableaux: group compositions that communicate power, chaos, intimacy, or ritual in one glance
- Each clip should have at least one "memorable frame" moment

### Camera Angles

**Eye Level:**
- Neutral, natural perspective
- Standard for most shots

**Low Angle:**
- Camera below subject
- Power, dominance, heroism
- Use for: Power moments, character elevation

**High Angle:**
- Camera above subject
- Vulnerability, weakness, perspective
- Use for: Vulnerability, overview, context

**Dutch Angle (Tilted):**
- Camera tilted on axis
- Unease, disorientation, energy
- Use sparingly: High energy, disorientation

### Lens Choices & Visual Perception

**Wide-Angle Lenses:**
- Exaggerate space and can impart surrealism or swagger
- Use for: Aggressive hip-hop, surreal concepts, power moments
- Low-angle wide-lens framing or fisheye-like distortion for surreal/aggressive styles
- Examples: Bad Romance (alien persona), HUMBLE. (power), Work It (playful distortion)

**Long Lenses:**
- Flatten space for a dreamy, painterly feel
- Create compression between foreground and background
- Use for: Intimate moments, dream sequences, emotional scenes

**Fisheye Lenses:**
- Create playful distortion and disorientation
- Use sparingly: High energy sections, surreal moments
- Can be digital effects or actual fisheye lens

**Lens Choice by Genre:**
- Hip-hop: Wide-angle for swagger, fisheye for playful distortion
- Pop: Balanced lenses, occasional wide-angle for fashion shots
- Indie/Art: Long lenses for intimacy, wide for atmosphere

## Character Planning Principles

### Character Consistency & Signature Look

**Core Principle:** Define the performer's signature look and maintain core identity across all clips.

**Signature Elements:**
- Define 1-3 recurring accessories or features (haircut, eye makeup, silhouette, prop)
- Examples: Red jacket, blonde wig, specific hairstyle, signature accessory
- These elements anchor character identity even when outfits or sets change
- Allow outfits or sets to change, but keep the core identity and attitude stable

**Appearance Consistency:**
- Same character should have consistent appearance across all clips
- Clothing, hair, physical features remain constant
- Minor variations acceptable (e.g., different angles, lighting, different outfits in same style)
- Core signature elements must remain recognizable

**Character Arc Through Visuals:**
- Use wardrobe and styling to chart character arcs
- Outfits can evolve with the narrative (e.g., captive → dominatrix, alone → empowered)
- Visual changes should match narrative progression
- Example: Character starts in dark → ends in light, starts alone → ends with others
- Consider visual progression throughout video

### Character Distribution

**Main Character:**
- Should appear in 60-80% of clips
- Ensures narrative consistency
- Too few appearances: Loses narrative thread
- Too many appearances: Lacks variety

**Supporting Characters:**
- 1-2 supporting characters maximum
- More characters = confusion and inconsistency
- Supporting characters appear in 20-40% of clips
- Clear role distinction (friend, antagonist, etc.)

**Background Characters:**
- Can appear in multiple clips for atmosphere
- Less detailed descriptions (crowd, silhouettes)
- Don't compete with main character for attention

### Character Roles

**Main Character:**
- Primary focus of video
- Drives narrative
- Most screen time
- Detailed description required

**Supporting Character:**
- Interacts with main character
- Supports narrative
- Moderate screen time
- Clear role definition

**Background:**
- Atmosphere and context
- Minimal screen time
- Generic descriptions acceptable
- Don't distract from main narrative

---

## Scene Planning Principles

### Scene Variety

**Optimal Scene Count:**
- 2-4 distinct scenes for 3-5 minute video
- Too few scenes: Repetitive, boring
- Too many scenes: Confusing, lacks consistency
- Scene changes should align with song structure

**Scene Transitions:**
- Plan scene changes at structural boundaries
- Verse → Chorus: Good transition point
- Chorus → Verse: Good transition point
- Avoid mid-verse scene changes (disrupts flow)

### Scene Consistency

**Location Logic:**
- Scenes should make narrative sense
- Don't jump illogically (desert → arctic without reason)
- Consider: How does character get from A to B?
- Use transitions to explain location changes

**Visual Consistency:**
- Same location should have consistent:
  - Lighting style
  - Color palette
  - Time of day
  - Weather/atmosphere
- Minor variations acceptable (different angles, camera movements)

**Time of Day:**
- Consistent time of day per scene
- Day → Night transitions should be intentional
- Use fade/crossfade for time transitions
- Consider: Does time change make narrative sense?

### Scene Types

**Interior Scenes:**
- Controlled lighting
- Consistent environment
- Easier to maintain visual consistency
- Examples: Room, studio, club, car

**Exterior Scenes:**
- Natural lighting (varies by time of day)
- More dynamic environment
- Harder to maintain consistency
- Examples: Street, park, beach, rooftop

**Abstract/Surreal Scenes:**
- Non-realistic environments
- Creative freedom
- Still maintain style consistency
- Examples: Dream sequences, abstract spaces, color washes

## Storytelling Modes

**Core Principle:** Pick ONE storytelling mode and commit to it throughout the video.

### 1. Narrative + Performance Hybrid
- Combine mini-story segments with dance or performance scenes
- Map verses, choruses, and bridges to specific story beats
- Examples: Thriller (horror narrative + dance), Bad Romance (kidnapping story + performance), Take On Me (comic book adventure)
- Use for: Songs with clear narrative potential, character-driven concepts

### 2. Symbolic Collage
- Assemble vignettes around a theme rather than a plot
- Use repeated motifs and juxtapositions to communicate ideas
- Examples: Formation (cultural references), HUMBLE. (religious/luxury imagery), This Is America (social commentary)
- Use for: Concept-driven songs, thematic exploration, symbolic meaning

### 3. Pure Performance Concept
- Focus on a singular conceit—complex dance routine, performance in single location
- Let variation in movement provide progression
- Examples: Here It Goes Again (treadmill routine), Chandelier (apartment dance), Cellophane (pole performance)
- Use for: Performance-focused songs, choreography showcases, minimalist concepts

### 4. Surreal Episodic Set-Pieces
- Present a series of imaginative scenes connected by energy and attitude rather than story logic
- Each set piece introduces a new visual trick or transformation
- Examples: Work It (surreal transformations), Bad Romance (surreal fashion sequences)
- Use for: Experimental songs, surreal concepts, visual effects showcases

**Choosing a Mode:**
- Consider song genre, lyrics, and user prompt
- Commit to one mode for consistency
- Don't mix modes (e.g., don't start narrative then switch to pure performance)
- Map song structure (verse/chorus/bridge) to mode-specific beats

---

## Genre-Specific Conventions

### Pop & Glam
- Emphasize catchy hooks through recurring visual motifs
- High fashion and glamour
- Hybrid narrative/performance structures allow for story arcs without sacrificing dance and spectacle
- Clear story beats with fashion-forward aesthetics
- Examples: Bad Romance, Thriller

### Hip-Hop & R&B
- Keep the artist front and centre
- Play with lens distortion, bold lighting, and symbolic imagery
- Reference power, spirituality, community, or politics
- Use slow motion and match cuts to accentuate swagger
- Wide-angle lenses for power, fisheye for playful distortion
- Examples: HUMBLE., Formation, Work It, This Is America

### Indie & Performance Art
- Embrace minimalism and authentic movement
- Long takes and negative space draw attention to performer's physicality and emotion
- Performance intensity leads the visual
- Minimal sets, focus on performer
- Examples: Chandelier, Cellophane

### Experimental & Surreal
- Incorporate world-switch transitions, morphing effects, and unusual physical transformations
- Symbolism takes precedence over literal storytelling
- Visual tricks and effects drive the concept
- Examples: Take On Me, Work It, Cellophane
